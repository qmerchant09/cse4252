1: The print method that was called on b was the print method for class A. The output of thiswas 

var = 1
var = -2

To get the correct output I changed the print in A to be virtual, doing this allows the correct print function to be called at run time. The output I got for this was 

var = 1 
varB = 0
var = -2
varB = 0

2: I would expect the print statment of class A to be printed both times.

The output was 
var = 0
var = 0

This behavior is different than question 1 because the pointer in this question is of type A so it is using the A print not B. 

3: Calling the print method like that on object b would call the class A print. The output of this is 

var = 0

4: Yes you can pass an object of B into the return function. Running the program didnt cause an error or segmentation fault to occur. 

5: Changing the class declaration causes errors whenever the A and B class interact.
